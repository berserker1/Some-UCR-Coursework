2. Strengths 

Does the paper solve the problem well?
Does the idea bring a significant benefit over prior work?
Does it work with reasonable assumptions?

Think critically. Many papers do not explicitly state their weaknesses. Even if some are discussed in the paper, there could be even more.
Some questions you may ask are:
Are there any hidden assumptions?
Is it only applicable to a special case or limited types of systems?
Are the experiment results inconsistent?
Is the benefit marginal?

What are the important things you can take out of it?
Can you do better than this?
Is there a better way (e.g., simpler) to achieve the same goal?
Any room for improvement?
Is the idea still valid in today's systems?
What you learned/enjoyed most in the paper
